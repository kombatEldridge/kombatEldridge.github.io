# Second Year Conference 

On April 4th, 2024, I had my second year conference in front of my five-member committee. Here are the notes.

### Presentation of the Topic
In a year I will have my Prospectus where I need to prove to my adivsors and the committee that I can be trusted to finish out the PhD on my own. One note they made sure to let me know about is that if I am going to present on Quantum Chemistry, I should relay the equations to them as well as prove my full understanding of the methods employed by my research. 

### MEEP to QM Software
When MEEP calls Bohr, the timing for the RK4 method isn't correct and needs to happen about 100 times more before it calls MEEP again. This is a units issue.

### Advertising
As any good project needs to sell its usefulness, we have decided to try to cater to the QM computation community. The QM side of the project can be done by many QM softwares available, so we want to make a plugin of sorts that is capable of using any software a researcher is comfortable using.
