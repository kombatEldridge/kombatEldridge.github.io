Hello! My name is Brinton Eldridge and this is my blog dedicated to reporting my work and progress in my field.

I graduated from Freed-Hardeman University in the Spring of 2022 with a B.S. in Biochemistry and a B.S. in Mathematics.

I am currently enrolled as a Ph.D. student at the University of Memphis and have decided to work with Dr. Yongmei Wang's Nanomedicine research group.

I do not have any current plans on what to do after graduating with my Ph.D., but I know that God has opened many doors for me in the past, and I know that he will continue to help me walk through more.

For a tutorial on how I made this blog page, visit [this link](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) or look at my first blog for my thoughts.

### Proverbs 3: 3-4 (NIV)

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Let love and faithfulness never leave you; bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart.
Then you will win favor and a good name in the sight of God and man.
